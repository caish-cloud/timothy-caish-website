# Portfolio Website

This is a website I built for myself that shows off my talents as a web developer!

Technologies used:
- React with TypeScript (Library and language)
- Next.js (framework)
- Chakra UI (Component library and styling)
- Framer Motion (Animation)
- Zustand (State management)
- Supabase (Database)
- i18n (Localization)
- BugSnag (Bug monitoring)
- Mixpanel (Analytics)

### Run Locally

1. Fork the repo
2. `cd` into the folder
3. `yarn` or `npm i` to install packages
4.  `yarn start` or `npm start`
5. If you want to use your own Supabase, Mixpanel, or BugSnag accounts, you can update the `.env` appropriately
